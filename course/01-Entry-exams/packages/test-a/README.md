# TEST A - basic level

## Results
This api (https://rapidapi.com/contextualwebsearch/api/web-search) didn't work for me (403/405 htpp errors) so I took https://rapidapi.com/serpsbot/api/google-search5
The folder Results contains results that I obtained during program execution.
You need insert your "x-rapidapi-key" in the key.js to make it work.
Results stored in dist folder.
run 'npm build-dev' for testing
